Click on stuff to play. Hit Escape to exit.

Ascension.

You are magically infused cat who is trying to reach a higher plane of existence. Nirvana if You will. 

You have an ability to trade Your age for free stuff. 

But free stuff ain't free, there is a curse. You're not getting any money when You sell stuff. You're getting value of the trade added to Your age. And your ageing speed is influenced by events happening in the world as well as the stuff you own.
Sell too much and You die quickly. Of old age.
Buy too much useless shit and You poof out of existence.

Any time You can choose to end the game by ASCENDING!
